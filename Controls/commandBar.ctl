'PhotoDemon Tool Dialog Command Bar custom control
'Copyright 2013-2015 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 14/August/13
'Last updated: 14/November/14
'Last update: add preset support for the new pdTextBox control
'
'For the first decade of its life, PhotoDemon relied on a simple OK and CANCEL button at the bottom of each tool dialog.
' These two buttons were dutifully copy+pasted on each new tool, but beyond that they received little attention.
'
'As the program has grown more complex, I have wanted to add a variety of new features to each tool - things like dedicated
' "Help" and "Reset" buttons.  Tool presets.  Maybe even a Randomize button.  Adding each of these features to each tool
' individually would be a RIDICULOUSLY time-consuming task, so rather than do that, I have wrapped all universal tool
' features into a single command bar, which can be dropped onto any new tool form at will.
'
'This command bar control encapsulates a huge variety of functionality: some obvious, some not.  Things this control handles
' for a tool dialog includes:
' - Unloading the parent when Cancel is pressed
' - Validating the contents of all numeric controls when OK is pressed
' - Hiding and unloading the parent form when OK is pressed and all controls successfully validate
' - Saving/loading last-used settings for all standard controls on the parent
' - Automatically resetting control values if no last-used settings are found
' - When Reset is pressed, all standard controls will be reset using an elegant system (described in cmdReset comments)
' - Saving and loading user-created presets
' - Randomizing all standard controls when Randomize is pressed
' - Suspending effect previewing while operations are being performed, and requesting new previews when relevant
'
'This impressive functionality spares me from writing a great deal of repetitive code in each tool dialog, but it
' can be confusing for developers who can't figure out why PD is capable of certain actions - so be forewarned: if
' PD seems to be "magically" handling things on a tool dialog, it's actually off-loading the heavy lifting to this
' control!

Option Explicit

'Clicking the OK and CANCEL buttons raise their respective events
Public Event OKClick()
Public Event CancelClick()

'Clicking the RESET button raises the corresponding event.  The rules PD uses for resetting controls are explained
' in the cmdReset_Click() sub below.  Additionally, if no last-used settings are found in the Data/Presets folder,
' this event will be automatically triggered when the parent dialog is loaded.
Public Event ResetClick()

'Clicking the RANDOMIZE button raises the corresponding event.  Most dialogs won't need to use this event, as this
' control is capable of randomizing all stock PD controls.  But for tool dialogs like Curves, where a completely
' custom interface exists, this event can be used by the parent to perform their own randomizing on non-stock
' controls.
Public Event RandomizeClick()

'All custom PD controls are auto-validated when OK is pressed.  If other custom items need validation, the OK
' button will trigger this event, which the parent can use to perform additional validation as necessary.
Public Event ExtraValidations()

'After this control has modified other controls on the page (e.g. when Randomize is pressed), it needs to request
' an updated preview from the parent.  This event is used for that; the parent form simply needs to add an
' "updatePreview" call inside.  (I could automate this, but some dialogs - like Resize - do not offer previews,
' so I thought it better to leave the implementation of this event up to the client.)
Public Event RequestPreviewUpdate()

'Certain dialogs (like Curves) use custom user controls whose settings cannot automatically be read/written as
' part of preset data.  For that reason, two events exist that allow the user to add their own information to a
' given preset.  These events are raised whenever a preset needs to be saved or loaded from file (either the
' last-used settings, or some user-saved preset).
Public Event AddCustomPresetData()
Public Event ReadCustomPresetData()

'Sometimes, for brevity and clarity's sake I use a single dialog for multiple tools (e.g. median/dilate/erode).
' Such forms create a problem when reading/writing presets, because the command bar has no idea which tool is
' currently active, or even that multiple tools exist on the same form.  In the _Load statement of the parent,
' the setToolName function can be called to append a unique tool name to the default one (which is generated from
' the Form title by default).  This separates the presets for each tool on that form.  For example, on the Median
' dialog, I append the name of the current tool to the default name (Median_<name>, e.g. Median_Dilate).
