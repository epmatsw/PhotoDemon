'PhotoDemon Effect Preview custom control
'Copyright 2013-2015 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 10/January/13
'Last updated: 31/May/14
'Last update: convert custom mouse handling code to use pdInput
'
'For the first decade of its life, PhotoDemon relied on simple picture boxes for rendering its effect previews.
' This worked well enough when there were only a handful of tools available, but as the complexity of the program
' - and its various effects and tools - has grown, it has become more and more painful to update the preview
' system, because any changes have to be mirrored across a huge number of forms.
'
'Thus, this control was born.  It is now used on every single effect form in place of a regular picture box.  This
' allows me to add preview-related features just once - to the base control - and have every tool automatically
' reap the benefits.
'
'The control is capable of storing a copy of the original image and any filter-modified versions of the image.
' The user can toggle between these by using the command link below the main picture box, or by pressing Alt+T.
' This replaces the side-by-side "before and after" of past versions.
'
'A few other extra features have been implemented, which can be enabled on a tool-by-tool basis.  Specifically:
' 1) The user can toggle between "fit image" and "100% zoom + click-drag-to-scroll" modes.  Note that 100% zoom
'    is not appropriate for some tools (i.e. perspective transformations and other algorithms that only operate
'    on the full image area).
' 2) Click-to-select color functionality.  This is helpful for tools that rely on color information within the
'    image for their operation, e.g. green screen.
' 3) Click-to-select-coordinate functionality.  This is helpful for giving the user an easy way to select a
'    location on the image as, say, a center point for a filter (e.g. vignetting works great with this).
