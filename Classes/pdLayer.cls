'PhotoDemon Layers class
'Copyright 2012-2015 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 29/August/12
'Last updated: 06/July/14
'Last update: add variable performance/quality options to the thumbnail request functions
'
'Once upon a time, the pdLayer class was simply a DIB wrapper.  Once PhotoDemon moved to a fully layer-compatible
' image editor, however, it became necessary to separate Layer-specific functions from generic DIB functions.
'
'The current pdLayer class is a comprehensive wrapper for all types of PhotoDemon layers.  All layers share a few
' key components: position, blend mode, etc, and all (except adjustment layers) are expected to provide a copy of
' the layer's contents in DIB format.  The main viewport renderer doesn't care how this DIB is created - e.g.
' whether it comes from text or images or something fancy like vector rendering - it just cares that the DIB is
' present and appropriately sized for its contents.
'
'Because layers interact heavily with PDI files (PhotoDemon's custom file format), each layer must be capable of
' writing its relevant header data into an XML string, and recreating itself from such a string if necessary.
' Layer DIB data is always handled separately, as some layer types may need to recreate their DIBs on-the-fly.
'
'Layer blend modes are declared here, but the actual blending of layers happens in the pdCompositor class.  This was
' done to enable the blending of arbitrary DIBs not attached to layers, and to simplify this class (which is
' already quite large).  Note also that pdLayer objects have no knowledge of their parent pdImage object.  If
' interaction with the parent object is important, functions will explicitly request a pdImage reference as part
' of their function parameters.
