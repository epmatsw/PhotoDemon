'Exposure Dialog
'Copyright 2013-2015 by audioglider and Tanner Helland
'Created: 13/July/13
'Last updated: 09/August/13
'Last update: rewrote the exposure calculation to operate on a "stops" (power-of-2) scale

'Many thanks to talented contributor audioglider for creating this tool.
'
'Basic image exposure adjustment dialog.  Exposure is a complex topic in photography, and (obviously) the best way to
' adjust it is at image capture time.  This is because true exposure relies on a number of variables (see
' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_%28photography%29) inherent in the scene itself, with a technical definition
' of "the accumulated physical quantity of visible light energy applied to a surface during a given exposure time."
' Once a set amount of light energy has been applied to a digital sensor and the resulting photo is captured, actual
' exposure can never fully be corrected or adjusted in post-production.
'
'That said, in the event that a poor choice is made at time of photography, certain approximate adjustments can be
' applied in post-production, with the understanding that missing shadows and highlights cannot be "magically"
' recreated out of thin air.  This is done by approximating an EV adjustment using a simple power-of-two formula.
